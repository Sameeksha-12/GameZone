## **Description ðŸ“ƒ**
- This game is built using HTML, CSS and js .The connect four game can be compared to two players building a wall with a different colour of brick for each participant. The rule is straightforward: drop one brick at a time from each individual. A brick cannot stand alone in the air, just like an actual wall, so the player must place one brick on top of another. When one of the two players can arrange their bricks in a connect-four pattern, which consists of four bricks laid out horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, they have won the game.
